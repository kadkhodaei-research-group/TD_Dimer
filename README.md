# TD_Dimer
Temperature-Dependent Dimer (TD_Dimer): A saddle point search method designed for temperature-dependent energy surfaces that account for vibrational effects. Ideal for strongly anharmonic solids with low-temperature mechanical instability, where density functional theory forces are unsuitable for dimer searches.

# Under development
The code will be published soon.
